### About me

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Mathematics at Syracuse University. I finished my PhD in 2016 in the [Mathematics Department](https://www.math.uci.edu) at [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu), working with [Prof. Hongkai Zhao](https://www.math.uci.edu/~zhao/homepage/home/home.html) and [Prof. Babak Shahbaba](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~babaks/) on scalable Bayesian inference methods. 
I received my Bachelor degree (2008) in applied mathematics and Master degree (2011) in computational mathematics from Peking University.

- Working with html and css
- Finding a hosting site
- Transferring stuff to the hosting site -->

### Research interest

My research interest focus on optimization, augmented reality and machine learning. 

Examples of subjects of interest including:

- Nonconvex regularization. 
- Label placement in augmented reality.
- Wavelet neural network.
